Action - An action is a plain object describing what happened. 

For example:
{ type: 'LIKE_ARTICLE', articleId: 42 }
{ type: 'FETCH_USER_SUCCESS', response: { id: 3, name: 'Mary' } }
{ type: 'ADD_TODO', text: 'Read the Redux docs.' }

Think of an action as a very brief snippet of news. “Mary liked article 42.” or “'Read the Redux docs.' was added to the list of todos.”


Store - A single JS object that includes application state.

For example:
{ categories: [], products: [], cart: {}, user: {} }


Reducer - Reducers are pure functions, they get instance of current store and return the updated one. 

They don't touch global state, they don't mutate arguments.
